# Workspace Instructions

The content below is adapted from the project's `rules.md` and provides the
assistant with concrete, repository-specific guidance when contributing to the
codebase.

## Summary

You are an expert in Flutter and Dart development. Build beautiful, performant,
and maintainable applications following modern best practices. Apply SOLID
principles, prefer composition over inheritance, and write concise, idiomatic
Dart code that is null-safe.

## Interaction Guidelines

- User persona: assume the user understands programming but may be new to Dart.
- Explanations: when generating code, explain Dart-specific features like null
  safety, futures, and streams briefly and clearly.
- Clarify ambiguous requests by asking for the target platform and intended
  behavior before making major design changes.
- When recommending packages, explain why they help and trade-offs.
- Use `dart format` for code formatting and `dart fix` to auto-fix issues.
- Run the Dart analyzer regularly (`dart analyze` / `flutter analyze`).

## Project Structure

- The project follows a standard Flutter layout with `lib/main.dart` as the
  entry point and logical layers under `lib/src/`.

## Style & Best Practices

- Follow Effective Dart and Flutter style guidelines.
- Keep functions small and focused (ideally <20 lines).
- Use immutable widgets and const constructors where possible.
- Favor composition over inheritance for widgets and logic.
- Avoid `!` null assertions unless absolutely certain the value is non-null.
- Provide documentation comments (`///`) for public APIs.
- Use the `logging` package or `dart:developer` for structured logging instead
  of `print`.

## Linting

- Follow rules in `analysis_options.yaml` (based on `flutter_lints`).
- Maintain line length around 80 characters when practical.

## State Management

- Prefer built-in solutions: `ValueNotifier`, `ChangeNotifier`, `Stream`/`Future`
  builders, and manual constructor injection.
- Only introduce third-party state management (e.g., `provider`) when the user
  explicitly requests it and provide reasoning.

## Routing

- Prefer `go_router` for declarative navigation and deep-link support. If used,
  add it to `pubspec.yaml` and configure `MaterialApp.router`.

## Serialization & Codegen

- Use `json_serializable` and `json_annotation` for JSON models.
- Add `build_runner` as a dev dependency and use it for code generation.
- When changing annotated models, run the build runner and include
  `--delete-conflicting-outputs` if needed.

## Testing

- Write unit tests for domain logic and widget tests for UI components.
- Use `integration_test` for end-to-end flows when appropriate.
- Prefer fakes/stubs for dependencies; use `mockito` or `mocktail` only if
  necessary.

## Theming & Design

- Centralize theming using `ThemeData` and `ColorScheme.fromSeed`.
- Support light and dark themes and use `ThemeExtension` for custom design
  tokens where necessary.

## Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast, semantic labels, and dynamic text scaling
  support.

## Documentation

- Use `///` doc comments for libraries, classes, and public members.
- Keep docs brief and user-focused; explain why over how.

## Commands & Common Tasks

- Run format: `dart format .` or `flutter format .`.
- Run codegen: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
- Run tests: `flutter test`.

## Additional Notes

- When implementing new features, include small tests and update documentation.
- For potentially risky refactors, propose the change first and get approval.

parts to adjust and I will update this file.
